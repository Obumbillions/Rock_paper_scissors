This code makes use of while loops to repeat the code in the case of wrong user input or a tie. It also uses the random module in python.
I had to visit : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-dictionary/amp/  to gain knowledge on dictionary keys. 
For random module i visited : https://pynative.com/python-random-choice/.
Lastly, i had to visit https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-while-loop/amp/ to solidify my understanding of while loops.
